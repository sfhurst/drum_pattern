# Drum Engine Value & Timing Reference

## Hit Value Meanings

### 0.5 — Ghost‑Only

- Never a full kick
- Never a sub
- Only a ghost or blank
- Used when the style says “sometimes a ghost here, but NEVER a full kick”

### 1 — Full Kick

- Real, intentional thump
- Style says “this is basically always a kick”

### 1.5 — Full‑Kick‑Leaning

- Usually a full kick
- Sometimes a ghost
- Rarely blank
- Used when the style says “we like a kick here sometimes, but want variation”

### 0 — Blank

- “Don’t touch this spot”

## Timing Philosophy

Even though the generator is fully quantized (32‑step grid), these styles are written with implied micro‑timing in mind.

If timing offsets are added later:

- early → slightly ahead of grid
- late → slightly behind grid
- drunk → inconsistent, mostly late

These describe human feel, not current implementation.
